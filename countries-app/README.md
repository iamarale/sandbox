# Rest Countries App

This is one of many projects I've created in my sandbox enviroment. It's a simple app that fetches data from the [rest countries api](https://restcountries.com/) and displays it in a table. This app was inspired by the [frontend mentors project](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).
